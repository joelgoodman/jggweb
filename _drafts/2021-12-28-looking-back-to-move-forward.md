excerpt: A great year behind and a great year ahead.
---

When I get to take a break, whether it's over holidays or not, I tend to use that time to think back a little on everything that's been going on. I think 2021 is going to turn out to be a pivotal year for me and my professional work, but even more so for my general life. I'm so grateful for the higher education web and marketing community I've grown up in professionally and this year in particular I made great strides.

The pandemic has been immensely difficult for everybody. After 2020, when universities weren't spending any money on marketing and Bravery Media had effectively no work in the pipeline, I didn't have a lot of hope for 2021. And, to be honest, things started off slow. I was even considering looking for a full-time job and winding down Bravery.

I'm fortunate to have friends like Seth Odell, whom I've worked with at various times spanning the last 10 years. Helping him out with Kanahoma projects bridged some of those work and income gaps the slow market was imposing.

Entrepreneurship can be hard. And I've been at it for nearly a decade. Despite my ongoing efforts to even out revenue I still experience the feast or famine realities of the services industry. This is especially underscored for my small shop as we tend to compete with agencies larger than our own. As a result, I've spent the last five or so years exploring how to maintain more consistent cash flow and minimize those extremes.

To my mind, the answer has been developing a product but that's a monumental task with a fair amount of initial capital expenditure. I made a start in 2020 but my partners in that ended up being pulled in other directions and we stalled out.

## Looking ahead
